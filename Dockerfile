# This Docker container is used to run the Python application.
# It is based on the official Python image and installs the required dependencies.
# The entrypoint is set to run the application.
# The application (in ./app) is not copied into the container, but mounted as a volume when the container is started.
# This way, the application can be updated without rebuilding the container.

# Use the official Python image
FROM python:3.14-slim

# Set the working directory
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

# Expose the port
